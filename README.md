Implementation of multi linear regression 

Multiple linear regression is used for cases where there are two or more different independent variables that are ultimately affecting the single dependent variable, which is what we are trying to predict. By finding a line of best fit, a relationship is established between the dependent variable for which we are predicting and the independent variables. Accuracy estimation is implemented using least square, which calculates residuals and finds the average distance of predicted values to the real values. The relationship between the independent variables and dependent variable is linear, otherwise, our algorithm will do a poor job at the prediction.
